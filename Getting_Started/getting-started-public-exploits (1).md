# Getting Started with Public Exploits

Public exploits are prewritten proof-of-concept code or attack modules you can use (carefully) against services you find during enumeration. After you discover a service and its version, searching public exploit databases can point you to known vulnerabilities and ready-made exploit code. Always confirm whether an exploit is reliable, whether it's been patched, and whether it's allowed in-scope.

> **Legal note:** Never run exploits against systems you do not own or have explicit, written permission to test. Exploitation can cause instability, data loss, and legal consequences.

## Where to look for public exploits?

- **Exploit-DB / `searchsploit`** — fast local searching of the Exploit-DB database.  
- **Metasploit Framework (`msfconsole`)** — large collection of modules with helper tools and payloads.  
- Vendor advisories, GitHub proof-of-concepts, and CVE pages are also useful for details and mitigations.

`searchsploit` helps you find exploits by product name, version, or CVE:

```bash
searchsploit openssh 7.2
```

You can mirror (copy) an exploit locally for inspection:

```bash
searchsploit -m <EXPLOIT_ID>
```

## Metasploit primer

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an integrated exploitation framework that helps automate exploitation, deliver payloads, and manage sessions.

Common workflow in `msfconsole`:

```bash
# start msfconsole
msfconsole

# search for modules
search exploit openssh v2.0

# use a module
use <module/path>

# view required options
show options

# set required options
set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>
set RPORT <PORT>
set LHOST <YOUR_IP>

# run a non-destructive check if available
check

# run exploit
exploit
```

- Use `show options` to see which inputs an exploit needs. Any option with **Required: yes** must be set for the exploit to work.
- Many modules support a `check` command to verify vulnerability non-destructively.
- If an exploit fails, read the module output carefully — missing preconditions (specific config or authentication) are common.

## Safety, reliability, and manual verification

- **Exploit reliability:** Public exploits are often proof-of-concept and may be flaky or destructive. Prefer `check` or safe verification where possible.  
- **Sandbox first:** Always test exploits in an isolated lab or VM first.  
- **Understand impact:** Some exploits crash services or change system state; know the consequences before running them on a live system.

## Exercise

Try to identify the services running on the server above, and then try to search to find public exploits to exploit them. Once you do, try to get the content of the `/flag.txt` file. (Note: the web server may take a few seconds to start.)

- Scan:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV [IP] -p PORT
```
- Search the services you enumerated from Nmap in Metasploit.
- Use `show options` and set `RHOST`, `RPORT`, and whatever else is needed.
- Check the files for the `flag.txt` file. :)
